HRV score

ibi: interbeat / R-R interval
sdnn: standard deviation of NN (R-R) intervals
sdsd: standard deviation of successive differences
rmssd:  Root mean square of the successive differences – used for a good snapshot 
of the Autonomic Nervous System’s Parasympathetic branch and is the basis of our “HRV Score”
NN20: the number of pairs of successive NNs that differ by more than 20 ms.
pNN20: the proportion of NN20 divided by total number of NNs.
NN50: the number of pairs of successive NNs that differ by more than 50 ms.
pNN50: the proportion of NN50 divided by total number of NNs.
MAD: median absolute deviation of RR intervals (MAD)
EBC: the range (max-min) within a moving window of a given time duration within the study period. The windows 
can move in a self-overlapping way or be strictly distinct (sequential) windows. EBC is often provided in data
acquisition scenarios where HRV feedback in real time is a primary goal. EBC derived from PPG over 10-second and
16-second sequential and overlapping windows has been shown to correlate highly with SDNN.
